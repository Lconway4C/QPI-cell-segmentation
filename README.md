# CellSNAP: a fast, accurate algorithm for 3D cell segmentation in quantitative phase imaging
MIP and MIP masks can be found in the sample data folder. Tomogram files can be found at the following link https://figshare.com/articles/media/RI_Tomogram_TIFF_file_sample_data/23547087

In segmenting_3d_cell_v5.m:
1. Assign path to tomogram file to phase_folder_3d variable
2. Assign path to mask files to mask_folder variable
3. Assign path to saving folder to saving_folder variable
